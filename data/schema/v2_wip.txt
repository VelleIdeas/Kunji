We may want to connect the paper table to Q n A tables eventually.    
    
	
											|--		Questions
											|			Id
											|			Title
											|			Body
											|			CreationDate
											|			Score			-Upvote/downvote score
											|			ViewCount		-Total views by users
Maybe these 2 tables are just 1 table.	----|			UserId			-Original poster's id
Since most of the fields are same.			|			Tags			-tags associated with the question. Need a better way to handle this.(?)
We can have a parentId to differentiate		|			AnswerCount		-total answers
between question and answer.				|			FavoriteCount	-total favorites by users
											|		Answers
											|			Id
											|			QuestionId
											|			Body
											|			CreationDate
											|			Score
